# Zorivest — Trader Readiness Protocol

> **Core Theory**: `Lifetime = (Purpose × Energy) / Stress`
>
> Your capacity to absorb risk is a finite resource. It's replenished by sleep, nutrition, purpose, and emotional stability — and depleted by conflict, pain, poor health, and undisciplined habits. If your stress budget is already spent before you enter a trade, you have no reserves for when markets move against you.

## The Science Behind It

The user's formula maps directly to established science:

| User's Concept | Scientific Framework | Key Research |
|---|---|---|
| **Energy** | **Body Budget** (Lisa Feldman Barrett) | Your brain runs a metabolic budget. Sleep debt = "body budget deficit" where energy withdrawals exceed deposits |
| **Stress** | **Allostatic Load** (McEwen & Stellar) | Cumulative wear from chronic stress. The EMAL model shows stress has a measurable energetic cost (PMC, 2023) |
| **Purpose** | **Intrinsic Motivation** (Self-Determination Theory) | Purpose provides resilience against setbacks. Steenbarger: traders with process goals outperform outcome-focused traders |
| **Risk Capacity** | **Cortisol × Decision Quality** | Higher cortisol → lower decision quality and more time pressure errors (ResearchGate, 2024). Sleep deprivation impairs prefrontal cortex → perseverative errors |

**Brett Steenbarger** (*The Daily Trading Coach*, 101 Lessons):
- Lesson 21: "The Importance of Feeling Good" — well-being precedes performance
- Lesson 24: "Trade with Energy" — energy management IS trade management
- Lesson 27: "Build Emotional Resilience" — resilience is a trainable skill
- Lesson 30: "Turn Stress into Well-Being" — reframe, don't suppress
- Lesson 31: "Self-Monitor by Keeping a Trading Journal" — psychological journal alongside trade journal

**Key insight from research**: Sleep mediates the relationship between life stressors and allostatic load. Traders who don't sleep well carry yesterday's stress into today's trades (PMC, 2024).

## Daily Readiness Checklist (MCP Conversational Flow)

This checklist is designed as an **AI-guided conversation**, not a form. The AI asks, the trader reflects. Responses are stored and tracked for pattern discovery.

### Phase 1: Body Budget Assessment (Can You Afford to Take Risk Today?)

```
AI: Good morning. Before we look at markets, let's check your readiness.
    How did you sleep last night?

    [ ] Deep, restorative (7-9h, woke refreshed)
    [ ] Adequate (6-7h or interrupted but functional)
    [ ] Poor (< 6h, restless, woke tired)
    [ ] Terrible (< 4h, insomnia, stressor kept you up)

AI: Rate your energy right now, 1-10.
    [___]

AI: Have you eaten today? What was your last meal?
    Specifically — are you running on caffeine alone, or did you
    have actual nutrition?

    [ ] Full meal with protein, hydrated
    [ ] Light meal or snack
    [ ] Just coffee / nothing yet
    [ ] Skipped yesterday's dinner too

AI: Any nutritional gaps you've been ignoring lately?
    (Low iron, dehydration, too much sugar, skipping meals when stressed)
    [free text]
```

**Scoring**: Sleep + Energy + Nutrition = **Physical Readiness Score (1-10)**

If score ≤ 4: ⚠️ *"Your body budget is in deficit. Your prefrontal cortex — the part that manages risk and inhibits impulse — runs on glucose and sleep. Trading today means trading with impaired hardware. Consider paper trading or observation only."*

---

### Phase 2: Emotional Load Assessment (What Stress Are You Already Carrying?)

```
AI: Have you had a conflict with anyone in the last 24 hours?
    (Partner, family, colleague, friend, online argument)

    [ ] No — relationships are stable
    [ ] Minor friction but resolved
    [ ] Unresolved tension (it's still on my mind)
    [ ] Significant conflict (fight, argument, emotional rupture)

AI: Are you experiencing any unexpected mental or physical pain?
    (Headache, anxiety, bad news, health concern, financial pressure
    outside of trading)

    [ ] No — baseline normal
    [ ] Minor annoyance / discomfort
    [ ] Moderate — it's competing for my attention
    [ ] Significant — I can't stop thinking about it

AI: Overall, what is your emotional state right now?

    [ ] Calm, focused, present
    [ ] Slightly anxious but manageable
    [ ] Frustrated / irritable / impatient
    [ ] Fearful / desperate / need-to-make-money
    [ ] Euphoric / overconfident (just as dangerous)

AI: On a scale of 1-10, how much emotional bandwidth do you have
    left for absorbing unexpected losses today?
    [___]
```

**Scoring**: Conflict + Pain + Emotional State + Bandwidth = **Emotional Readiness Score (1-10)**

If score ≤ 4: ⚠️ *"Your stress budget is already spent. You've used up the emotional reserves you'd need to stay disciplined when a trade goes against you. The most profitable decision today might be not trading. Your edge survives by not giving back gains on bad days."*

If "Euphoric" or "Overconfident" selected: ⚠️ *"Overconfidence is as dangerous as fear. Your last win is making you feel invincible. Reduce position sizes by 50% today or skip entirely. The market doesn't know about your winning streak."*

---

### Phase 3: Purpose Alignment (Why Are You Trading Today?)

```
AI: Before we look at setups — why are you trading today?

    [ ] My system has identified opportunities that match my criteria
    [ ] Routine — I trade every market day
    [ ] I feel like I should be doing something
    [ ] I need to make back yesterday's loss
    [ ] I have a strong conviction on a specific thesis

AI: What would a successful day look like that has nothing to do
    with P&L?

    (Examples: "I followed my plan on every trade", "I sized
    correctly", "I cut a loser quickly", "I sat on my hands when
    nothing set up")
    [free text]

AI: Remind yourself — how does money serve your purpose?
    What are you building toward? Why does discipline matter
    more than any single trade?
    [free text — stored for future reflection]

AI: Complete this sentence: "Today I will be disciplined because..."
    [free text]
```

**Red flags**: If "need to make back yesterday's loss" or "feel like I should be doing something" — this is revenge trading or boredom trading. The AI should escalate:

⚠️ *"You just described a pattern that shows up in your worst trading days. Looking at your history: when you trade to 'make back losses,' your average result is -$[X]. When you trade from a systems-based approach, your average result is +$[Y]. The disciplined choice is clear."*

---

### Phase 4: Pre-Trade Mental Rehearsal (The Execution Plan)

```
AI: For each trade you're considering today, let's mentally rehearse
    the execution:

    TRADE: [ticker] [direction]

    1. What is your thesis? (one sentence)
       [free text]

    2. At what price do you get OUT if wrong?
       (This is decided BEFORE entry, not during)
       [price]

    3. At what price do you start taking profit?
       [price]

    4. At what price do you move your stop to breakeven?
       [price]

    5. How will you handle it if the trade goes against you
       immediately after entry?
       [ ] I have a hard stop — I'll let it hit
       [ ] I'll evaluate and potentially exit manually
       [ ] I haven't thought about this (⚠️)

    6. What's the maximum you're willing to lose on this trade
       in dollar terms?
       [$___]

    7. Does this loss amount feel acceptable right now — would you
       be able to sleep tonight if you lost this much?
       [ ] Yes — this is within my risk budget
       [ ] It would sting but I'd be fine
       [ ] Honestly, I'd be upset (⚠️ reduce size)
```

---

### Phase 5: Post-Trade Reflection (After Markets Close)

```
AI: Markets are closed. Let's reflect on today.

    1. Did you follow your plan on every trade?
       [ ] Yes — every entry, stop, and target as planned
       [ ] Mostly — deviated once but caught myself
       [ ] No — I overrode my rules
       [ ] I didn't have a plan for some trades (⚠️)

    2. What action did you take today, and why?
       [free text — capture the reasoning chain while it's fresh]

    3. How did it feel?
       [ ] Fulfilling — win or lose, I traded well
       [ ] Neutral — just a day
       [ ] Frustrating — I made mistakes I know better than
       [ ] Euphoric — big win (⚠️ watch tomorrow's overconfidence)
       [ ] Angry — I want to fix it tomorrow (⚠️ revenge trading risk)

    4. Did the outcome match your conviction level?
       [ ] Yes — high conviction, good result
       [ ] Yes — low conviction, small/no trade
       [ ] No — high conviction, bad result (review thesis)
       [ ] No — low conviction but traded big anyway (⚠️ discipline gap)

    5. What would you do differently?
       [free text]

    6. What did you learn about yourself today?
       [free text — this is the meta-cognition that compounds over time]

## Composite Readiness Score

The AI calculates a daily readiness score before markets open:

```
Physical Readiness   (sleep + energy + nutrition)    : __/10
Emotional Readiness  (conflict + pain + bandwidth)   : __/10
Purpose Alignment    (motivation + discipline intent) : __/10
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL READINESS SCORE                                : __/30
```

| Score | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| **25-30** | ✅ Full trading — you're in optimal state |
| **18-24** | ⚡ Trade with awareness — reduce position sizes, stick to A+ setups only |
| **12-17** | ⚠️ Paper trade or observe only — your reserves are low |
| **< 12** | 🛑 Do not trade — the most profitable decision is sitting out |

---

## Pattern Tracking Over Time

The real power comes from correlating readiness scores with trading outcomes:

| Pattern the AI Can Discover | Example Insight |
|---|---|
| **Sleep → P&L correlation** | "On days you sleep < 6 hours, your average P&L is -$340. On 7+ hours, it's +$280." |
| **Conflict → overtrading** | "After relationship conflicts, you take 3.2x more trades than average. Your win rate drops from 58% to 31%." |
| **Revenge trading detection** | "You've traded to 'make back losses' 7 times. Average result: -$890. Your system wins when you don't." |
| **Purpose drift** | "Your discipline score has dropped from 8/10 to 5/10 over the last 2 weeks. Your stated purpose was [X] — is that still driving you?" |
| **Energy cycles** | "Your best trading days cluster on Tuesday-Thursday. Mondays (after weekend off) and Fridays (end-of-week fatigue) are your weakest." |
| **Cumulative edge** | "Your edge comes from 47 small wins averaging $340, not the 3 big wins. Your system works — stop swinging for home runs." |
