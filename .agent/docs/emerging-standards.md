## MCP Tool Standards

### M1 — Schema Field Parity
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical
- **Applies to:** MCP
- **Rule:** Every field that middleware or handlers inspect must be declared in the tool's Zod schema.
- **Origin:** 2026-03-19 — `confirmation_token` was consumed by `withConfirmation()` but missing from `create_trade` schema; Zod stripped it silently.
- **Bad example:** Middleware reads `params.confirmation_token` but field not in schema → stripped → middleware blocks forever
- **Good example:** Add `confirmation_token: z.string().optional()` to the tool's input schema

### M2 — API ↔ MCP Parity
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium
- **Applies to:** MCP
- **Rule:** For every REST API endpoint, verify a corresponding MCP tool exists with matching capabilities.
- **Origin:** 2026-03-19 — `DELETE /trades/{id}` existed in the API but no `delete_trade` MCP tool was wired.
- **Bad example:** API has 4 CRUD endpoints, MCP only exposes 3 → users can't delete via AI
- **Good example:** Checklist: GET→list, POST→create, PUT→update, DELETE→delete (with confirmation if destructive)

### M3 — Destructive Tool Gate
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical
- **Applies to:** MCP
- **Rule:** Destructive tools must be registered in `DESTRUCTIVE_TOOLS` set and wrapped with `withConfirmation()`.
- **Origin:** 2026-03-19 — `delete_trade` needed both the set entry and the middleware wrapper.
- **Bad example:** New destructive tool added with `registerTool()` only → no confirmation required
- **Good example:** Add to `DESTRUCTIVE_TOOLS`, wrap handler with `withConfirmation(toolName, handler)`

### M4 — Build dist/ After Source Changes
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical
- **Applies to:** MCP
- **Rule:** After editing `mcp-server/src/**`, run `cd mcp-server && npm run build` before testing live. The MCP server runs compiled JS from `dist/`, not source TS.
- **Origin:** 2026-03-19 — Schema fix applied to `src/` but MCP server kept running old `dist/`; required 2 unnecessary IDE restarts.
- **Bad example:** Edit source → restart IDE → wonder why fix didn't take effect
- **Good example:** Edit source → `npm run build` → restart IDE → test

### M5 — TDD Red Phase Must Fail for the Right Reason
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium
- **Applies to:** MCP, API
- **Rule:** When a TDD red-phase test fails, log the actual response and verify the failure matches the expected bug, not a test setup issue.
- **Origin:** 2026-03-19 — AC-1 vs AC-2 confusion cost ~30 lines of reasoning; the wrong test was assumed to be failing.
- **Bad example:** See "1 failed" → assume it's the test you just wrote → proceed to green phase
- **Good example:** Run with `--reporter=verbose`, confirm failure line + actual vs expected values

### M6 — No Vacuous Test Assertions
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium
- **Applies to:** MCP, API
- **Rule:** Tests must fail if the bug they target is reintroduced. A test that passes regardless of the fix is vacuous.
- **Origin:** 2026-03-19 — AC-1 ran in dynamic mode where `withConfirmation()` passes through regardless of token presence; test would pass with or without the schema fix.
- **Bad example:** Test in dynamic mode that succeeds whether field exists or not
- **Good example:** Test in static mode where missing field causes middleware to block → test fails → proves schema preserved the field

## GUI Standards

### G1 — Buttons Must Have Visible Borders
- **Severity:** 🟢 Minor
- **Applies to:** GUI
- **Rule:** All interactive buttons must have a visible border or background to distinguish them from plain text.
- **Origin:** 2026-03-19 — Save/Cancel buttons rendered as borderless text, users didn't recognize them as clickable.
- **Bad example:** `className="text-sm text-fg"` — looks like a label
- **Good example:** `className="px-4 py-1.5 rounded-md border border-bg-subtle bg-bg hover:bg-bg-elevated"`

### G2 — Destructive Buttons Disabled When Inapplicable
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium
- **Applies to:** GUI
- **Rule:** Destructive actions (Delete, Remove) must be disabled or hidden when they don't apply (e.g., on unsaved new records).
- **Origin:** 2026-03-19 — Delete button shown on new trade form before the trade was saved.
- **Bad example:** Delete button always visible and clickable, even on new records
- **Good example:** `disabled={!existingTrade}` or conditionally render

### G3 — Server-Side Search for Lists > 50 Items
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical
- **Applies to:** GUI, API
- **Rule:** Any list that can exceed 50 items must use server-side search, not client-side filtering. Command palettes must not hold large datasets.
- **Origin:** 2026-03-19 — Command palette tried to cache all trades as Fuse.js entries; user said "this app will have THOUSANDS of trades."
- **Bad example:** Load all records into memory → filter with `useMemo` → breaks at scale
- **Good example:** Debounced input → `GET /api/v1/trades?search=NVDA&limit=25` → paginated results

### G4 — Pagination Defaults: 25/Page with Count
- **Severity:** 🟢 Minor
- **Applies to:** GUI
- **Rule:** Tables default to 25 rows per page. Footer shows `Page X of Y (N items)`.
- **Origin:** 2026-03-19 — `pageSize=50` matched API `limit=50`, showing "Page 1 of 1" with no count.
- **Bad example:** `pageSize: 50` + API `limit: 50` → always 1 page
- **Good example:** `pageSize: 25` + API `limit: 200` → `Page 1 of 4 (100 trades)`

### G5 — Auto-Refresh for Externally Mutated Data
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium
- **Applies to:** GUI
- **Rule:** Queries whose data can change from external sources (MCP, API, other windows) must use `refetchInterval` polling.
- **Origin:** 2026-03-19 — Trades created via MCP didn't appear in GUI until manual page reload.
- **Bad example:** Query with no `refetchInterval` → stale data until user navigates away and back
- **Good example:** `refetchInterval: 5_000` on the trades query

### G6 — Field Name Contracts
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical
- **Applies to:** GUI
- **Rule:** UI components must use the exact field names from the API response type. Never assume field names without checking the TypeScript interface.
- **Origin:** 2026-03-19 — `useDynamicEntries.ts` used `trade.id` and `trade.symbol` but API returns `trade.exec_id` and `trade.instrument`.
- **Bad example:** `trade.id` → `undefined` because field is actually `exec_id`
- **Good example:** Reference the `Trade` interface: `trade.exec_id`, `trade.instrument`

### G7 — Column Truncation Minimum 15 Characters
- **Severity:** 🟢 Minor
- **Applies to:** GUI
- **Rule:** Table columns that truncate text must show at least 15-20 characters before ellipsis.
- **Origin:** 2026-03-19 — Account column truncated at 5 characters, making IDs unreadable.
- **Bad example:** `val.slice(0, 5) + "…"` → `"U1234…"` — can't distinguish accounts
- **Good example:** `val.length > 20 ? val.slice(0, 20) + "…" : val`

### G8 — OpenAPI Spec Regen After Route Changes
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical
- **Applies to:** API, Infra
- **Rule:** After any API route change, run `uv run python tools/export_openapi.py --check openapi.committed.json`. If drift detected, regenerate with `-o`.
- **Origin:** 2026-03-19 — Added `search` query param to trades route, CI quality gate failed due to spec drift.
- **Bad example:** Add new query param → commit → CI fails → debug for 10 minutes
- **Good example:** Add param → `--check` → `❌ drift` → `-o` regen → commit with spec

### G9 — Search Must Include All User-Visible Text Columns
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium
- **Applies to:** GUI, API
- **Rule:** Search/filter must cover every text column visible in the table, including notes and formatted timestamps.
- **Origin:** 2026-03-19 — Initial search only matched instrument, exec_id, account_id. User expected to search by notes and date.
- **Bad example:** Search covers 3 of 8 visible columns → user types note content → no results
- **Good example:** `OR` filter across all text columns + `strftime` for datetime

### G10 — DateTime Search via strftime Not CAST
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium
- **Applies to:** API (SQLite)
- **Rule:** When searching datetime columns as text, use `strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M', column)` not `CAST(column AS TEXT)`.
- **Origin:** 2026-03-19 — `CAST(time AS TEXT)` produced unusable format in SQLite; searching "2026" returned nothing.
- **Bad example:** `cast(TradeModel.time, String).like(pattern)` — format is implementation-dependent
- **Good example:** `func.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M', TradeModel.time).like(pattern)`

### G11 — Global Actions Must Route Through AppShell via Custom Events
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical
- **Applies to:** GUI
- **Rule:** Command palette actions and global keyboard shortcuts that open modals/panels must be owned by `AppShell` (always-mounted root), not by feature-specific layouts. Use custom DOM events (`window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('zorivest:action-name'))`) to bridge the command registry → AppShell gap.
- **Origin:** 2026-03-20 — Position Calculator command palette entry was a console-log stub. After wiring it to `PlanningLayout`, it only worked on the `/planning` page. Keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+C` had the same bug — the `useEffect` listener was inside `PlanningLayout` which only mounts on one route.
- **Bad example:** Calculator state + `Ctrl+Shift+C` listener inside `PlanningLayout` → only works when user is on `/planning` page → Command Palette "Position Calculator" does nothing on `/trades`
- **Good example:**
  1. `commandRegistry.ts`: `action: () => window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('zorivest:open-calculator'))`
  2. `AppShell.tsx`: `useEffect(() => { window.addEventListener('zorivest:open-calculator', handler); ... }, [])`
  3. `AppShell.tsx`: Renders `<PositionCalculatorModal>` + owns `calculatorOpen` state + `Ctrl+Shift+C` listener
  4. `PlanningLayout.tsx`: Calculator button dispatches same event: `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('zorivest:open-calculator'))`

**Pattern summary:**

| Layer | Responsibility | File |
|-------|---------------|------|
| Command Registry | Dispatch named custom event | `commandRegistry.ts` |
| AppShell | Listen for event + own state + render modal + own keyboard shortcut | `AppShell.tsx` |
| Feature Layout | Button triggers same event (convenience shortcut) | e.g. `PlanningLayout.tsx` |

**Event naming convention:** `zorivest:{verb}-{noun}` (e.g. `zorivest:open-calculator`, `zorivest:import-trades`, `zorivest:start-review`)

**Checklist for new global actions:**
1. [ ] Modal/panel component exists with `isOpen` + `onClose` props
2. [ ] State + `useEffect` listener added to `AppShell.tsx`
3. [ ] `commandRegistry.ts` action dispatches `CustomEvent`
4. [ ] Keyboard shortcut listener in `AppShell.tsx` (not feature layout)
5. [ ] Feature page button (if any) dispatches same `CustomEvent`
6. [ ] Tests verify event dispatch (not modal presence in feature layout)

## Pagination Standards

### P1 — Paginated Responses Must Return Real DB Count
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical
- **Applies to:** API, MCP
- **Rule:** Every paginated list endpoint must return the real database count (matching the same filters) in the `total` field, not `len(items)` from the current page.
- **Origin:** 2026-03-19 — `list_trades` returned `total: 100` (page size) instead of real DB count. MCP agents had no way to discover how many trades exist without fetching all of them.
- **Bad example:** `total=len(items)` — always equals page size; agents can't detect more pages
- **Good example:** `total=service.count_trades(account_id=account_id, search=search)` — real count from DB

**Implementation template** (6 layers, bottom-up):

**Layer 1 — Repository Port** (`ports.py`):
```python
def count_filtered(
    self,
    account_id: str | None = None,
    search: str | None = None,
) -> int:
    """Return total count matching filters (ignoring limit/offset)."""
    ...
```

**Layer 2 — SQLAlchemy Repository** (`repositories.py`):
```python
def _build_filter_query(self, account_id=None, search=None):
    """Shared filter builder (used by both list + count)."""
    query = self._session.query(Model)
    if account_id:
        query = query.filter(Model.account_id == account_id)
    # ... same filter logic as list_filtered ...
    return query

def list_filtered(self, limit, offset, account_id, sort, search):
    query = self._build_filter_query(account_id, search)
    # add sort + offset + limit
    return query.offset(offset).limit(limit).all()

def count_filtered(self, account_id, search):
    return self._build_filter_query(account_id, search).count()
```

**Layer 3 — In-Memory Stub** (`stubs.py`):
```python
def count_filtered(self, account_id=None, search=None, **kw):
    items = list(self._store.values())
    # apply same filters as list_filtered (no slice)
    return len(items)
```

**Layer 4 — Service** (`*_service.py`):
```python
def count_items(self, account_id=None, search=None) -> int:
    with self.uow:
        return self.uow.repo.count_filtered(account_id=account_id, search=search)
```

**Layer 5 — API Route** (`routes/*.py`):
```python
items = service.list_items(limit=limit, offset=offset, ...)
total = service.count_items(account_id=account_id, search=search)
return PaginatedResponse(items=items, total=total, limit=limit, offset=offset)
```

**Layer 6 — MCP Tool Description** (`*-tools.ts`):
```typescript
description: "List items with pagination. Returns {items, total, limit, offset} "
    + "where `total` is the real database count matching filters (not page size). "
    + "Use limit=1&offset=0 to efficiently discover total count before fetching all.",
```

**Key principles:**
- Extract shared filter logic into `_build_filter_query()` to avoid duplication between list + count
- Count query uses same filters as list but no `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`/`ORDER BY`
- MCP description must explicitly tell agents that `total` is real, and suggest `limit=1` for count-only discovery
- For datasets < 100K rows, inline COUNT is negligible cost; at scale, consider caching or approximate counts

## Date & Time Formatting

### DT1 — Trade Timestamp Display Format
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium
- **Applies to:** GUI
- **Rule:** Format all trade/event timestamps as `MM-DD-YYYY h:mmAM/PM` (e.g. `03-20-2026 2:35PM`). Never use locale strings (`toLocaleString`, `Mar 20, 2026`).
- **Origin:** 2026-03-20 — Trade picker displayed `"3/20/2026, 2:35:00 PM"` (locale format); required format `"03-20-2026 2:35PM"`.
- **Bad example:** `new Date(iso).toLocaleString()` → `"3/20/2026, 2:35:00 PM"` (varies by locale)
- **Good example:**
  ```ts
  function formatTimestamp(iso: string | null | undefined): string {
      if (!iso) return ''
      const d = new Date(iso)
      const mm = String(d.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0')
      const dd = String(d.getDate()).padStart(2, '0')
      const h = d.getHours() % 12 || 12
      const minutes = String(d.getMinutes()).padStart(2, '0')
      const ampm = d.getHours() >= 12 ? 'PM' : 'AM'
      return `${mm}-${dd}-${d.getFullYear()} ${h}:${minutes}${ampm}`
  }
  ```

### DT2 — No Seconds in UI Display
- **Severity:** 🟢 Minor
- **Applies to:** GUI
- **Rule:** Trade timestamps in the UI omit seconds (`h:mmAM/PM`, not `h:mm:ssAM/PM`). Full ISO precision is preserved in the data layer.
- **Origin:** 2026-03-20 — Seconds added visual noise without adding value for typical trading use cases.
- **Bad example:** `"03-20-2026 2:35:12PM"` — seconds shown
- **Good example:** `"03-20-2026 2:35PM"` — minutes-only display

## GUI Element System Decisions

Decisions made based on web research (UX Stack Exchange, Nielsen Norman Group, IxDF, Material Design) during the 2026-03-24 MEU-70b session. Apply these patterns whenever similar controls appear in any Zorivest GUI.

### UX1 — Mutually Exclusive State Controls: Segmented Buttons, Not Select + Buttons
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical
- **Applies to:** GUI
- **Rule:** For 2–5 mutually exclusive options with known labels (status, direction, timeframe), use a **segmented button group** (`<div role="group">` of `<button>`s). Never combine a `<select>` and tag buttons for the same field.
- **Origin:** 2026-03-24 MEU-70b — Trade Planner had a status `<select>` AND four tag buttons. Clicking a tag did nothing until the dropdown was changed first (two controls, one truth). Research: UX Stack Exchange + r/userexperience confirm segmented buttons are canonical for ≤5 known options.
- **Bad example:** `<select>` for status + separate quick-transition `<button>` row → user must think about which control to use
- **Good example:**
  ```tsx
  <div className="flex gap-1" role="group" aria-label="Plan status">
      {OPTIONS.map(({ value, label, activeClass }) => (
          <button key={value} aria-pressed={current === value}
              onClick={() => setCurrent(value)}
              className={current === value ? activeClass : 'ghost-class'}>
              {label}
          </button>
      ))}
  </div>
  ```
- **Visual rule:** Active state = filled background + colored text. Inactive = ghost/muted, no fill.
- **Color conventions:**

  | State | Classes |
  |-------|---------|
  | Draft | `bg-bg-elevated text-fg border-bg-subtle` |
  | Active | `bg-blue-500/20 text-blue-300 border-blue-500/40` |
  | Executed | `bg-green-500/20 text-green-300 border-green-500/40` |
  | Cancelled | `bg-red-500/15 text-red-400 border-red-500/30` |

### UX2 — Conditional Fields: Responsive Enabling (Grayout + Tooltip), Not Progressive Disclosure (Hide)
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium
- **Applies to:** GUI
- **Rule:** When a field requires a prerequisite state, **disable it with a tooltip** explaining the prerequisite — do not hide it. Hidden fields are not discoverable; disabled fields teach the causal relationship.
- **Origin:** 2026-03-24 MEU-70b — "Link to Trade" picker was hidden behind `{isExecutedStatus && ...}`. Users had no way to discover the field or understand that Executed status would reveal it. NNG + IxDF: responsive enabling is preferred when the field's existence *signals a capability*; progressive disclosure only for entire optional sections.
- **Bad example:** `{condition && <TradePickerField />}` — field doesn't exist until condition is met; not discoverable
- **Good example:**
  ```tsx
  <input
      disabled={!condition}
      placeholder={condition ? 'Filter trades...' : 'Set status to Executed first'}
      title={!condition ? 'Change status to Executed to link a trade' : undefined}
      className={condition
          ? 'bg-bg border-green-500/30'
          : 'opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed bg-bg-elevated'}
  />
  ```
- **When to use progressive disclosure instead:** Only when the field is always irrelevant unless a major condition is met AND there is a visible containing section header explaining the context.

### UX3 — Combobox/Picker: Show Selected Label in Input After Selection (Not Search Text)
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium
- **Applies to:** GUI
- **Rule:** When a user selects an item from a combobox picker list, the **input shows the selected item's human-readable label** and the list collapses. A `×` clear button deselects. Never leave the search query text in the input after selection.
- **Origin:** 2026-03-24 MEU-70b — Trade linker picker showed `✓` on the selected item while the list was visible, but the input still showed the search query (`"8:"`) after scrolling away. NNG combobox pattern + Material Design: input value must reflect the selection post-close.
- **Bad example:** User searches `"8:"`, selects trade, input still shows `"8:"` — unclear what is linked
- **Good example:**
  ```tsx
  // Two states: search text (typing) vs label (selected)
  <input value={pickerLabel || pickerSearch}
      onChange={(e) => { setPickerLabel(''); setPickerSearch(e.target.value) }} />
  // On item select:
  setPickerLabel(humanLabel)   // collapses list
  setPickerSearch('')
  // List rendered only when: isActive && !pickerLabel
  ```
- **Clear button rule:** Absolute-positioned `×` inside the input wrapper; visible only when `pickerLabel` is set.

### G12 — Modal Positioning: Fixed-Top, Not Centered
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium
- **Applies to:** GUI
- **Rule:** Modals that contain dynamic-height content (autocomplete dropdowns, loading states, expandable sections) must use fixed-top positioning (`items-start pt-[10vh]`), not vertical centering (`items-center justify-center`). Centering causes the modal to jump/shift whenever content height changes.
- **Origin:** 2026-04-05 — Position Calculator modal jumped on every keystroke and dropdown toggle because `items-center` recalculated vertical position as the autocomplete dropdown appeared/disappeared.
- **Bad example:** `className="fixed inset-0 flex items-center justify-center"` → modal bounces when dropdown opens
- **Good example:** `className="fixed inset-0 flex items-start justify-center pt-[10vh]"` → modal stays pinned

### G13 — Archived/Soft-Deleted Entities: Include in Name Lookups with Suffix
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical
- **Applies to:** GUI, API
- **Rule:** When an entity is soft-deleted (archived), it must remain resolvable in name lookup maps for related data. Fetch with `include_archived=true` for lookup queries and append `(Archived)` to the display name. The main entity list page should still exclude archived items.
- **Origin:** 2026-04-05 — Archiving an account caused all trades referencing it to display raw UUIDs instead of the account name, because the accounts query excluded archived accounts from the name map.
- **Bad example:** `GET /api/v1/accounts` (excludes archived) → trades show `"a1b2c3d4-..."` for archived account
- **Good example:**
  ```tsx
  // Lookup query includes archived for name resolution
  apiFetch('/api/v1/accounts?include_system=true&include_archived=true')
  // Name map appends suffix
  m.set(a.account_id, a.is_archived ? `${a.name} (Archived)` : a.name)
  ```
- **Decision rationale:** Sequential thinking analysis of 5 options (suffix, generic label, reassign, styling, transparent) — suffix preserves full history context and is the industry-standard pattern used by brokerage platforms.

### G14 — Auto-Populate Related Fields on Entity Selection
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium
- **Applies to:** GUI
- **Rule:** When a user selects a primary entity (ticker, account) from an autocomplete/dropdown, auto-populate related dependent fields (price, balance, stop/target) from a live data source. If dependent fields are at their default/zero value, fill them with the fetched value; if the user has already edited them, preserve the user's value.
- **Origin:** 2026-04-05/06 — Calculator and Trade Plan ticker selection did not auto-fill entry price from spot quote. Users had to manually type the current price after selecting a ticker, defeating the purpose of the autocomplete. Stop/target at 0 also needed seeding.
- **Bad example:** Ticker selected → only ticker field updated → entry/stop/target stay at 0 → user must look up and type current price
- **Good example:**
  ```tsx
  const handleTickerSelect = useCallback((result) => {
      apiFetch(`/api/v1/market-data/quote?ticker=${result.symbol}`)
          .then((quote) => {
              const price = Math.round(quote.price * 100) / 100
              setEntryPrice(price)
              setStopPrice((prev) => (prev === 0 ? price : prev))
              setTargetPrice((prev) => (prev === 0 ? price : prev))
          })
  }, [])
  ```
- **Consistency rule:** If this pattern exists in one form (Calculator), apply it to all forms with the same field (Trade Plan, Watchlist). Use [TickerAutocomplete's `onSelect` callback](file:///p:/zorivest/ui/src/renderer/src/components/TickerAutocomplete.tsx#L17) to wire it uniformly.

### G15 — API Conflict/Error Responses Must Surface in UI
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical
- **Applies to:** GUI, API
- **Rule:** Every mutation hook (`useMutation`) must have an `onError` handler that parses the API error response (especially 409 Conflict) and displays it to the user. Silent swallowing of API errors is never acceptable for destructive operations.
- **Origin:** 2026-04-05 — Deleting an account with assigned trades returned 409 Conflict from the API, but the frontend `deleteAccount.mutate()` had no `onError` callback — the error was silently swallowed, and the user saw no feedback.
- **Bad example:**
  ```tsx
  deleteAccount.mutate(id) // no onError → 409 silently swallowed
  ```
- **Good example:**
  ```tsx
  const [deleteError, setDeleteError] = useState<string | null>(null)
  deleteAccount.mutate(id, {
      onError: (err: Error) => {
          try {
              const body = JSON.parse(err.message.split('\n').pop() ?? '')
              setDeleteError(body.detail ?? 'Deletion failed')
          } catch {
              setDeleteError(err.message || 'Deletion failed')
          }
      },
  })
  // Render dismissible error banner when deleteError is set
  ```
- **Checklist for new mutations:**
  1. [ ] `onError` handler added to `mutate()` call
  2. [ ] Error state variable declared for UI display
  3. [ ] Error banner/toast rendered with dismiss capability
  4. [ ] 409 Conflict `detail` field parsed for actionable message

### G16 — Electron CSP Must Include img-src for Local API Images
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical
- **Applies to:** GUI (Electron)
- **Rule:** The Electron renderer's `Content-Security-Policy` meta tag must include `img-src 'self' http://localhost:* http://127.0.0.1:* data:`. Without this, `<img>` tags pointing to the local API will silently fail (`naturalWidth === 0`) with no console error.
- **Origin:** 2026-04-06 — Screenshots uploaded via the API rendered as broken images in the ScreenshotPanel. Root cause: `default-src 'self'` blocked images from `http://127.0.0.1:17787`. No browser console error was visible; debugging required checking `naturalWidth` in DevTools.
- **Bad example:** CSP with only `default-src 'self' http://localhost:*` — `default-src` does NOT cascade to `img-src` for cross-origin images when the page is loaded from `file://` or Electron's custom protocol
- **Good example:**
  ```html
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
    content="default-src 'self' http://localhost:* http://127.0.0.1:*;
             img-src 'self' http://localhost:* http://127.0.0.1:* data:;
             script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'" />
  ```
- **Debugging tip:** If images fail to load in Electron, inspect with `document.querySelector('img').naturalWidth` — `0` means CSP blocked, not a network error.
- **Checklist for CSP changes:**
  1. [ ] `img-src` directive explicitly listed (not relying on `default-src` fallback)
  2. [ ] Both `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` origins included (Node may resolve either)
  3. [ ] `data:` included if thumbnails use data URIs
  4. [ ] E2E test verifies `naturalWidth > 0` on at least one `<img>` element

### G17 — Fetch Wrapper Must Detect FormData and Omit Content-Type
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium
- **Applies to:** GUI (API client)
- **Rule:** Any shared `fetch` wrapper that sets `Content-Type: application/json` must detect when the request body is a `FormData` instance and omit the `Content-Type` header entirely. The browser auto-sets `multipart/form-data` with the correct boundary; manually setting it corrupts the boundary.
- **Origin:** 2026-04-06 — Image upload via `apiFetch()` returned 422/400 because the wrapper injected `Content-Type: application/json` on a `FormData` body, corrupting the multipart boundary. The server couldn't parse the file.
- **Bad example:**
  ```ts
  // Always sets JSON content type — breaks FormData uploads
  const res = await fetch(url, {
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: data,
  })
  ```
- **Good example:**
  ```ts
  const headers: Record<string, string> = {}
  if (!(body instanceof FormData)) {
      headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
  }
  const res = await fetch(url, { headers, body })
  ```
- **When this applies:** Any time a new file upload feature is added that uses the shared `apiFetch`/`fetchWithAuth` wrapper.

## E2E Testing Standards

### E1 — E2E Test Data Seeding Must Use Node fetch, Not page.request
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium
- **Applies to:** GUI (E2E/Playwright)
- **Rule:** When seeding test data in Playwright E2E tests for Electron apps, use Node's native `fetch()` (runs in the test process) instead of Playwright's `page.request.post()` (routes through the Electron renderer's network stack). The renderer may enforce CSP, CORS, or other policies that block test seeding requests.
- **Origin:** 2026-04-06 — E2E test `seedImage()` used `page.request.post()` with multipart data. The request failed because it was routed through the Electron renderer's network context, which applied the app's CSP policy. Switching to Node's native `fetch()` bypassed this entirely.
- **Bad example:**
  ```ts
  // Routes through Electron's network stack → CSP may block
  const res = await page.page.request.post(`${API}/trades/${id}/images`, {
      multipart: { file: { ... } },
  })
  ```
- **Good example:**
  ```ts
  // Runs in Node context → bypasses Electron CSP/CORS
  const formData = new FormData()
  formData.append('file', new Blob([png], { type: 'image/png' }), 'test.png')
  const res = await fetch(`${API}/trades/${id}/images`, {
      method: 'POST',
      body: formData,
  })
  ```
- **Rule of thumb:** `page.request` is for testing the app's own API behavior (verifying CORS, auth headers). `fetch()` is for seeding test fixtures that should not be subject to the app's security policies.
