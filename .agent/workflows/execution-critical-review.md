description: Implementation-review-only critical review workflow. Reviews completed work handoffs for correctness, test rigor, and contract compliance.
---

# Execution Critical Review Workflow

Use this workflow to adversarially review **completed implementation work** that has produced handoff artifacts. This workflow produces findings only — it never fixes issues or reviews unstarted plans.

This is the workflow for prompts like:

- "Critically review the latest handoff"
- "Check if the claimed changes were actually completed"
- "Find regressions after a refactor"

// turbo-all
// NOTE: turbo-all sets SafeToAutoRun=true for non-destructive commands (rg, Get-Content, etc.).
// It does NOT override AGENTS.md §Commits: "Never auto-commit." Git commit/push still requires explicit user direction.

## Write Scope (Non-Negotiable)

This is a review-only workflow.

Allowed file writes:

- `.agent/context/handoffs/{plan-folder-name}-implementation-critical-review.md`
- optional `pomera_notes` session memory

Forbidden file writes:

- all product code (`packages/`, `ui/`, `mcp-server/`)
- tests
- docs outside the canonical review handoff
- plan files
- existing work handoffs under review

If a finding suggests a fix, record it in the canonical review handoff and stop. Do not patch the repo. Use `/execution-corrections` for fixes.

---

## Role Sequence

1. `orchestrator` (scope + auto-discovery)
2. `tester` (evidence/verification commands)
3. `reviewer` (severity-ranked findings and verdict)

> `researcher` is optional only when external fact-checking is required.
> **No coder role.** This workflow produces findings only — never fixes. Use `/execution-corrections` to resolve findings.

---

## Auto-Discovery (No User Input Required)

The agent discovers the review target automatically.

### Discovery Steps

```powershell
# 1. Find recent execution plan folders FIRST
Get-ChildItem docs/execution/plans/ -Directory |
  Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending | Select-Object -First 5

# 2. Inspect the newest candidate plan's task state
Get-Content docs/execution/plans/<candidate>/task.md

# 3. Find most recent WORK handoffs (exclude review artifacts)
Get-ChildItem .agent/context/handoffs/*.md -Exclude README.md,TEMPLATE.md |
  Where-Object { $_.Name -notmatch '(critical-review|corrections|recheck)' } |
  Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending | Select-Object -First 10

# 4. Correlate handoffs to the candidate plan by date/slug
rg -n "<candidate-date>|<candidate-slug>|Create handoff:|Handoff Naming" \
  .agent/context/handoffs docs/execution/plans/<candidate>
```

### Mode Confirmation

Choose this workflow (implementation review) when:

1. Work handoff artifacts already exist for the target project
2. `task.md` shows implementation tasks are completed or in-progress
3. The user explicitly requested review of a completed handoff

If the plan is genuinely unstarted (no handoffs, all tasks pending), use `/plan-critical-review` instead.

### Correlation Rule

The agent must correlate the handoff and plan folder — not blindly pair the newest of each. Use the date prefix and slug to match.

### Project-Integrated Handoff Expansion (Required)

When the correlated plan folder represents a multi-MEU project, the latest handoff is only the **seed** — not the full review scope.

Expand the review to the full correlated handoff set when any of these are true:

1. `implementation-plan.md` has a `Handoff Naming` section with multiple handoff paths
2. `task.md` has multiple `Create handoff:` checklist items
3. The plan, reflection, or registry states that multiple MEUs were executed in the same project
4. Multiple same-date sequenced handoffs clearly belong to the correlated plan folder

When expansion triggers, required scope becomes:

- every handoff produced by that project
- the correlated `implementation-plan.md` and `task.md`
- shared project artifacts (`meu-registry.md`, reflection, metrics)
- all changed files claimed across the full handoff set

### Scope Override

If the user provides explicit paths, use those instead of auto-discovery.

If the user provides one handoff path from a multi-MEU project but does not say `only`, expand to the full correlated handoff set.

### Canonical Review File Rule

Derive the review handoff path from the correlated execution plan folder:

- `.agent/context/handoffs/{plan-folder-name}-implementation-critical-review.md`

Example: `docs/execution/plans/2026-03-07-commands-events-analytics/` → `.agent/context/handoffs/2026-03-07-commands-events-analytics-implementation-critical-review.md`

If the canonical review file already exists, append a new dated section.

### Zorivest Build-Plan Scope Rule

When the target artifact describes work on `docs/build-plan/`:

- Inspect `docs/build-plan/` only when:
  - the docs are the feature under review,
  - the handoff claims specific build-plan updates as evidence,
  - or a docs discrepancy appears to misstate delivered behavior, contracts, or test coverage.
- When in scope, inspect the **actual file state/changes** (not just handoff claims).
- If `git diff` is not sufficient, use direct file reads and explicitly say so.

---

## Workflow Steps

## Step 1: Discover and Scope the Review (Orchestrator)

Run the auto-discovery commands. Identify:

- **Primary review target**: the work handoff set correlated to the newest plan candidate
- **Seed handoff**: the most recent correlated work handoff
- **Secondary scope**: the execution plan folder whose date/slug matches
- **Claimed changes**: files changed, phrases renamed, sections removed/added, verification commands/results

---

## Step 2: Load Context and Evidence (Orchestrator + Tester)

Read:

1. Primary target artifact (seed handoff)
2. Correlated execution plan (`implementation-plan.md` and `task.md`)
3. Every sibling handoff identified from the correlated project
4. Claimed files from the full handoff set
5. Relevant related files likely to drift
6. Current diffs (`git diff`) for the claimed files when available
7. For Zorivest build-plan sessions: actual changed `docs/build-plan/*` files

---

## Step 3: Run Critical Verification Sweeps (Tester)

Use fast, reproducible command checks. Prefer `rg`.

### Required Sweep Types

1. **Runtime / contract verification** — Does the delivered code satisfy the claimed API, UI, persistence, and round-trip behavior?
2. **Test rigor audit** — Do tests assert meaningful behavior, or do they trivially pass? (See IR-5)
3. **Negative-path / failure-path verification** — Tests and code cover rejected writes, missing data, invalid transitions?
4. **Claim verification** — Did the files/lines/behaviors mentioned in the handoff actually change?
5. **Cross-handoff consistency** — Shared totals, phase-gate claims, registry state consistent across the full project?
6. **Verification quality** — Are handoff checks strong enough?
7. **Evidence quality** — Commands/tests reproducible and auditable?
8. **Actual build-plan file changes** — When in scope, did claimed changes materially appear?
9. **Residual references / cross-file consistency** — Old names/phrases/slugs still present?

### Suggested Commands (Adapt Per Task)

```powershell
# 1) Read the primary review artifact
Get-Content <primary-artifact>

# 2) Check for stale references
rg -n "<old-term>" <relevant-dirs>

# 3) Inspect diffs
git diff -- <claimed-files>

# 4) List changes
git status --short -- <scope-dirs>
```

---

## Step 4: Adversarial Review (Reviewer)

Use the reviewer role output contract. Report **findings first**.

### Functionality-First Rule

Prioritize:

1. Runtime behavior and API/UI contract correctness
2. TDD/test rigor and negative-path coverage
3. Persistence and round-trip correctness
4. Handoff claim accuracy
5. Documentation consistency

Documentation-only discrepancies are non-blocking by default unless they misstate delivered behavior, falsely claim tests, hide missing work, or create unsafe instructions.

### Implementation Review Checklist (Required)

| # | Check | What To Look For |
|---|---|---|
| IR-1 | Live runtime evidence | Integration test without dependency overrides exists and was run |
| IR-2 | Stub behavioral compliance | Stubs honor save→get consistency, filter semantics, correct `exists()` returns |
| IR-3 | Error mapping completeness | Every write-adjacent route maps `NotFoundError → 404`, `BusinessRuleError → 409`, `ValueError → 422` AND tests assert response body shape |
| IR-4 | Fix generalization | When a finding was fixed, similar instances in other files/routes were also checked and fixed |
| IR-5 | Test rigor audit | Every test file in scope is audited for assertion strength. Each test rated 🟢 Strong / 🟡 Adequate / 🔴 Weak. Any 🔴 is `Medium` minimum |
| IR-6 | Boundary validation coverage | For every write surface: explicit schema exists, negative tests cover malformed input, unknown fields handled, create/update parity verified |

#### IR-5 Test Rigor Grading Criteria

| Rating | Definition | Example |
|--------|------------|---------|
| 🟢 Strong | Asserts specific values, exercises real behavior, tests positive and negative paths | `assert delta.days == 30` |
| 🟡 Adequate | Tests the right thing but uses weak assertions | `assert "key" in result` |
| 🔴 Weak | Trivially passes even if code is broken | `try: fn() except: assert dir.exists()` |

Common weakness patterns to flag:

- Try/except safety nets
- Asserting only key existence instead of values
- Patching private methods
- Testing only "not found" path without insert+get round-trip
- Missing boundary assertions
- Data format assertions checking existence not content

### Docs Review Checklist (Required when docs are in scope)

| # | Check | What To Look For |
|---|---|---|
| DR-1 | Claim-to-state match | Handoff says a change happened and file state proves it |
| DR-2 | Residual old terms | Old phrase/slug variants still present |
| DR-3 | Downstream references updated | Indexes, cross-links, and anchors updated |
| DR-4 | Verification robustness | Handoff checks would actually catch regressions |
| DR-5 | Evidence auditability | Commands/diffs are reproducible |
| DR-6 | Cross-reference integrity | Architectural changes consistent across canonical docs |
| DR-7 | Evidence freshness | Handoff-claimed counts match reproduced command output |
| DR-8 | Completion vs residual risk | If gaps acknowledged, conclusion must NOT say "all ACs met" |

### Severity Guidance

- `Critical`: Dangerous instructions/security regressions
- `High`: Incorrect contracts, false implementation claims, broken runtime behavior
- `Medium`: Weak tests, verification quality, portability issues
- `Low`: Auditability, wording, minor evidence gaps

---

## Step 5: Write or Update the Canonical Review Handoff (Required Exit Gate)

Write to: `.agent/context/handoffs/{plan-folder-name}-implementation-critical-review.md`

If that file already exists, append a new dated review update section.

The workflow is incomplete until the canonical review handoff exists and is readable.

> **Start from** [`.agent/context/handoffs/REVIEW-TEMPLATE.md`](file:///p:/zorivest/.agent/context/handoffs/REVIEW-TEMPLATE.md) (v2.1)
>
> **Verbosity control**: Set `requested_verbosity` in the review YAML frontmatter. See `.agent/docs/context-compression.md §Verbosity Tiers`.

Fill the template sections:
- `Findings` table with severity-ranked findings and file:line references
- `Checklist Results` with IR/DR check outcomes
- `Verdict` with explicit `approved` or `changes_required`

### Required Review Handoff Content

1. Scope reviewed (including correlation rationale and expanded handoff set)
2. Commands executed
3. Findings with file/line references
4. Explicit verdict (`approved` or `changes_required`)
5. Concrete follow-up actions
6. If not the first pass, a dated update heading

---

## Pre-Edit Guard

Before any file edit:

1. derive the canonical review handoff path for implementation review mode
2. verify the intended edit target exactly matches that canonical handoff path

If the target path is anything else, abort the edit and continue in findings-only mode.

---

## Step 6: Save Session Memory (Optional but Recommended)

Save a short `pomera_notes` entry summarizing:

- what was reviewed
- key findings
- whether fixes should be applied via `/execution-corrections`

---

## Hard Rules

1. **Never fix issues during this workflow.** This workflow produces findings only. Use `/execution-corrections` to resolve findings.
2. **Do not approve based on phrase-only grep checks** when heading renames or link anchors are involved.
3. **Do not treat the handoff as source of truth**; treat file state + diffs as source of truth.
4. **Do not bury findings behind summaries**; findings come first.
5. **For implementation reviews, do not elevate documentation drift above broken behavior or weak tests.**
6. **When a correlated project produced multiple MEU handoffs, load all of them.** The newest is only the discovery seed.
7. **Never review a review.** Auto-discovery excludes `*critical-review*`, `*-corrections*`, `*-recheck*` handoffs.
8. **When implementation-review findings require changes, route the fix phase through `/execution-corrections`.**
9. **One rolling review file per target.** Keep implementation-review updates in the same `-implementation-critical-review.md` file.
10. **When test files are in review scope, audit every test for assertion strength (IR-5).**
11. **A weak or misleading test is `Medium` minimum when it can allow broken behavior to pass green.**
12. **Do not return a final response until the canonical review handoff has been created or updated successfully.**
13. **Do not modify any file unless the Pre-Edit Guard resolves to the canonical review handoff path.**

## Done Checklist

- [ ] No product files were modified
- [ ] Canonical review handoff was created or updated
- [ ] Review mode was correctly identified as `implementation`
- [ ] Verdict is explicit (`approved` or `changes_required`)
- [ ] Final user response includes the canonical review handoff path

---

## Output Contract

Return to the user:

- Auto-discovered targets (what was reviewed, correlation rationale)
- Findings (severity-ranked, file/line references)
- Open questions / assumptions
- Review verdict (`changes_required` or `approved`)
- Residual risk statement
- Path to the created or updated canonical review handoff

---

## Orchestration Flow

This workflow is part of a four-workflow orchestration cycle:

1. `/create-plan` → plan new work
2. `/plan-critical-review` → review a new plan before implementation
3. `/execution-critical-review` → review completed implementation work (this workflow)
4. `/execution-corrections` → resolve implementation-review findings

When to switch:

- Use `/plan-critical-review` for reviewing unstarted plans (not this workflow).
- Use `/execution-corrections` if the verdict is `changes_required` and the user wants fixes applied.
- Use `/create-plan` for new feature implementation.

## HARD STOP

> [!CAUTION]
> **Do NOT autonomously chain into `/execution-corrections` or any other workflow after completing this review.** You MUST stop here and report the canonical review handoff path to the user. The user decides what happens next.

**Workflow complete.** Report the handoff path and wait for user direction.

## Completion Timestamp

The **very last line** of the agent's chat response must be the timestamp skill output, copied verbatim.

This is a hard exit requirement for every `/execution-critical-review` response, including short rechecks.

Required sequence:

1. Invoke the timestamp skill by reading `.agent/skills/timestamp/SKILL.md`.
2. Run the stamp script with the Windows redirect-to-file pattern:

```powershell
# // turbo
python .agent/skills/timestamp/scripts/stamp.py *> C:\Temp\zorivest\stamp.txt
```

3. Read `C:\Temp\zorivest\stamp.txt` with the file viewer.
4. Copy the file's single output line verbatim as the final chat line.

No text, bullets, caveats, or sign-off may appear after the timestamp line.

Compressed variant for rechecks:

```text
Recheck appended to <canonical-review-path>. Verdict: <approved|changes_required>. Key evidence: <one sentence>.
🕐 Completed: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM (TZ)
```

The compressed variant still requires invoking the timestamp skill and copying its real output verbatim for the last line.
