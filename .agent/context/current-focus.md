## Active Phase

**Phase 1 — Domain Layer (P0)**

## Current Priority

Begin Phase 1 Domain implementation using the new role-based workflow.

## Next Steps

1. Start first scoped task with orchestrated workflow:
   - Use `.agent/workflows/orchestrated-delivery.md`
   - Create task handoff from `.agent/context/handoffs/TEMPLATE.md`
2. Begin Phase 1 implementation:
   - Trade entity + unit tests
   - Account entity + unit tests
   - PositionSizeCalculator refinement + edge case tests
   - Port interfaces (TradeRepository, ImageRepository, AbstractUnitOfWork)
