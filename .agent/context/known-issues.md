## Active Issues


### [STUB-RETIRE] — stubs.py contains legacy stubs that should be retired progressively
- **Severity:** Low (technical debt)
- **Component:** api (`stubs.py`), tests
- **Discovered:** 2026-03-19
- **Status:** Phase 1+2 cleaned; Phase 3 tracked
- **Phase 2 resolved (MEU-PW1, 2026-04-12):** `StubMarketDataService` and `StubProviderConnectionService` deleted. `MarketQuote` import removed from stubs.py.
- **Phase 3 blocked on:** `StubAnalyticsService` (MEU-104–116), `StubReviewService` (MEU-110), `StubTaxService` (MEU-123–126). Each retires when its real service is implemented.
- **Roadmap:** [09a §Stub Retirement Roadmap](../docs/build-plan/09a-persistence-integration.md)


### [MCP-TOOLDISCOVERY] — MCP tool descriptions lack workflow context and examples for AI discoverability
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Component:** mcp-server
- **Discovered:** 2026-04-12
- **Status:** Open — requires full audit of all 9 toolsets
- **Details:** Server instructions and tool descriptions are too terse for AI agents to discover and correctly use multi-step workflows. Confirmed gaps in scheduling toolset: (1) server instructions say only "Automated task scheduling" — no mention of policy CRUD or pipeline execution, (2) `run_pipeline` description doesn't explain the approval prerequisite or error return shape, (3) `create_policy` has no example of the expected `policy_json` structure, (4) `pipeline://policies/schema` and `pipeline://step-types` MCP resources aren't referenced in any tool description, (5) no workflow guidance for the `create → approve → run` lifecycle. Similar gaps likely exist across `accounts`, `trade-analytics`, `trade-planning`, `market-data`, and other toolsets.
- **Next steps:** Full audit of all toolset descriptions against their actual API contracts. Improve server instructions with toolset workflow summaries. Add `policy_json` examples to `create_policy`. Reference MCP resources from tool descriptions. Ensure all tool descriptions include prerequisite state, return shape hints, and error conditions.

## Mitigated / Workaround Applied

### [MCP-TOOLCAP] — IDE tool limits render 68-tool flat registration non-viable
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Component:** mcp-server
- **Status:** Mitigated by Design — three-tier strategy (static ≤40 for Cursor, dynamic toolsets for VS Code, full for CLI/API)

### [MCP-ZODSTRIP] — `server.tool()` silently strips arguments with z.object()
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Component:** mcp-server
- **Status:** Open — upstream SDK bug (TS-SDK #1291, #1380, PR #1603)
- **Workaround:** Enforce raw shape convention. Startup assertion for non-empty `inputSchema.properties`.

### [MCP-AUTHRACE] — Token refresh race condition under concurrent tool execution
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Component:** mcp-server
- **Status:** Open — needs architectural mitigation
- **Workaround:** In-memory mutex for refresh; proactive JWT expiry check.

### [MCP-WINDETACH] — Node.js `detached: true` broken on Windows since 2016
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Component:** infrastructure
- **Status:** Open — upstream Node.js bug (#5146, #36808)
- **Workaround:** Windows Job Objects for process group management.

### [MCP-HTTPBROKEN] — Streamable HTTP transport has 5 failure modes
- **Severity:** High
- **Component:** mcp-server
- **Status:** Mitigated by Design (stdio primary). Pin SDK version. Never use stateless mode.

### [MCP-DIST-REBUILD] — MCP server runs from compiled `dist/`, not source `src/`
- **Severity:** High
- **Component:** mcp-server
- **Status:** Active — by design
- **Workaround:** After any `mcp-server/src/` change: `cd mcp-server && npm run build` then restart IDE.

### [UI-ESMSTORE] — electron-store v9+ (ESM-only) crashes electron-vite main process
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Component:** ui
- **Status:** Workaround Applied — pinned to `electron-store@8` (last CJS version)

### [E2E-AXEELECTRON] — `@axe-core/playwright` AxeBuilder incompatible with Electron sandbox
- **Severity:** High
- **Component:** ui (E2E tests)
- **Status:** Workaround Applied — load axe-core via `file://` URL + `page.evaluate()`

### [E2E-AXESILENT] — Accessibility scan failures are silent if the scanner itself crashes
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Component:** ui (E2E tests)
- **Status:** Active — process awareness. Wrap scan in try/catch during debugging.

### [E2E-ELECTRONLAUNCH] — Playwright `Process failed to launch!` in headless/sandboxed environments
- **Severity:** High
- **Component:** ui (E2E tests)
- **Status:** Active — environment-specific. E2E verified locally; Codex validates unit/integration only.
- **Resolution path:** `xvfb-run npx playwright test` in CI.
